              I&apos;m a Computer Science graduate from the University of San Francisco with a focus on 
              artificial intelligence, machine learning, and full-stack web development. I&apos;m passionate 
              about building applications that solve real problems and deliver great user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              My experience spans from developing ML pipelines and Random Forest models to creating 
              production-ready web applications. I&apos;ve also led teams to improve operations and 
              profitability, combining strong technical execution with practical business judgment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I&apos;m focused on building my portfolio of deployed projects while searching 
              for software engineering opportunities. I&apos;m particularly interested in roles where I 
              can contribute to impactful products and continue growing as a developer.
